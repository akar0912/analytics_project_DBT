# Analytics Engineering Assessment

## What is being assessed:
- **Data Modelling**: ability to design a comprehensive and intuitive data model that accurately represents 
business processes and unlocks the potential for analytics
- **Code Quality**: ability to write clean, understandable and performant analytics code using DRY principles

One of the ways Bitvavo earns passive income is by staking cryptocurrencies. Think of staking as depositing 
cryptocurrencies in a "high-yield savings account". Assets are locked up for a certain term. In exchange 
for locking up these assets, Bitvavo receives rewards in either the same asset or others as staking rewards.

You are provided with a [dbt project folder](https://github.com/bitvavo/data-analytics-engineering-assessment)
containing data related to cryptocurrency staking. The dataset includes information about the 
amount of assets staked and the expected rewards for various cryptocurrencies. 
Your goal is to build a small dbt project to answer the following question:
- How much asset is staked every consecutive day since the first of July 2023 until the current date, 
and how much reward is expected for each of those consecutive days?

## Requirements:
- The dataset is organized in CSV files, and you will need to create the necessary models to work with this data.
- The project should cover the period starting from July 1, 2023, until the current date 
(use the current date at the time of analysis).
- You should calculate and store the amount of assets staked for each consecutive day 
within the specified date range.
- Additionally, calculate and store the expected rewards for each of those consecutive days.

## Deliverables
- Properly organized and documented models.
- A README file containing a brief summary of your approach, any assumptions made, and any considerations
for performance and maintainability

If you have any questions or encounter any issues during this process, please feel free
